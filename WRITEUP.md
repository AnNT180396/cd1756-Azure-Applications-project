# Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.
*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
# Deployment Options Analysis for CMS Application

## 1. Virtual Machines (VM)

### 1.1 Costs
- VMs incur charges for compute, storage, and networking resources.
- Charges apply regardless of utilization, leading to higher costs during idle periods.
- Additional licensing costs may be required for certain OS or software (e.g., Windows Server).

### 1.2 Scalability
- Scalability requires manual intervention or configuration of Azure Scale Sets.
- Scaling up or out involves provisioning additional VM instances and balancing the load.
- Not ideal for dynamic workloads due to the manual overhead.

### 1.3 Availability
- Ensuring high availability requires setting up redundancy, load balancers, and multiple availability zones.
- More setup and management are needed compared to managed services like App Service.

### 1.4 Workflow
- Deployment is complex and involves managing the OS, security patches, and dependencies.
- Requires customized CI/CD pipelines to deploy applications.
- Greater effort is needed to maintain and secure the environment.

## 2. Azure App Service

### 2.1 Costs
- Offers a cost-efficient pay-as-you-go pricing model.
- Free Tier (F1) available for prototyping; higher tiers provide scaling and redundancy.
- Charges are based on usage, making it suitable for variable workloads.

### 2.2 Scalability
- Built-in autoscaling capabilities, allowing scaling up or out based on demand.
- Fully automated scaling reduces operational overhead.
- Designed for dynamic workloads with minimal configuration.

### 2.3 Availability
- High availability with built-in redundancy and disaster recovery options.
- Supports easy configuration for geo-redundancy across regions.

### 2.4 Workflow
- Simplified deployment workflow with native GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps integration.
- Infrastructure management is abstracted, enabling focus on application development.
- Ideal for rapid development and deployment cycles.

## 3. Recommendation
**Chosen Option**: **Azure App Service**

### Justify your choice:
- Azure App Service provides a **cost-effective**, **scalable**, and **highly available** solution compared to Virtual Machines.
- It simplifies deployment workflows and removes the need for infrastructure management, making it suitable for small-to-medium applications like a CMS.
- Automated scaling and built-in availability features make it a better choice for handling dynamic workloads without manual intervention.
- Developers can focus solely on building and maintaining the application rather than managing the underlying infrastructure.

# Assess app changes that would change your decision.

## 1. Changes to Application Requirements
If the application requirements evolve to demand **greater control over the infrastructure**, such as the ability to configure custom OS-level settings, manage specific networking setups, or utilize specialized software, the decision to use **Azure App Service** may need to be reconsidered. A shift to **Virtual Machines (VM)** could provide the necessary flexibility to customize the environment and optimize the infrastructure to meet advanced needs.

## 2. Additional Needs to Address
- **High-Performance Compute or Specialized Hardware**: If the app requires high-performance computing (HPC) or GPUs for intensive workloads, VMs with specific configurations would be better suited.
- **Compliance or Security Needs**: For applications requiring stricter compliance standards (e.g., HIPAA, FedRAMP) or the need to maintain sensitive data on isolated environments, VMs provide the ability to fully control and secure the environment.
- **Resource Utilization**: If the application experiences predictable and consistent workloads, VMs may become more cost-efficient than App Service for long-term usage.
- **Offline Development or Testing**: For scenarios where local development or testing on environments mimicking production is needed, VMs offer a portable solution.

## 3. Conclusion
The current decision to use **Azure App Service** aligns well with the CMS applicationâ€™s requirements for simplicity, scalability, and availability. However, if the application grows in complexity or introduces requirements for advanced infrastructure control, the decision may need to be revisited to leverage the benefits of **Virtual Machines**.
